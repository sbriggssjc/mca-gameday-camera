# mca-gameday-camera

This repository contains tools for processing sports game footage. The `motion_detector.py` script scans a video and prints timecodes for periods of high motion. These timecodes are useful for extracting highlight clips from a full game recording.

## Usage

```bash
python motion_detector.py path/to/video.mp4
```

You can adjust the detection sensitivity using `--threshold` and minimum segment length with `--min-duration`.
This repository provides a simple script for streaming a camera feed to
YouTube Live using RTMP. Frames are captured with OpenCV and piped to
`ffmpeg` for encoding and upload.

## Usage

```
python streamer.py <youtube_rtmp_url> [device_index]
```

Replace `<youtube_rtmp_url>` with the RTMP URL and stream key supplied by
YouTube. The optional `device_index` selects which local camera to use
(the default is `0`). Press `Ctrl+C` to end the stream.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

This repository contains simple utilities for analyzing football plays.

## Modules

- `play_classifier.py` â€“ provides the `PlayClassifier` class which wraps a
  YOLOv5 model to detect touchdown-like movements or fast exits of a
  player from the frame.
