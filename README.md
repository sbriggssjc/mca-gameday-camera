This repository contains tools for processing sports game footage. The `motion_detector.py` script scans a video and prints timecodes for periods of high motion. These timecodes are useful for extracting highlight clips from a full game recording.

## Usage

```bash
python motion_detector.py path/to/video.mp4
```

You can adjust the detection sensitivity using `--threshold` and minimum segment length with `--min-duration`.
